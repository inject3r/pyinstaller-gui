## Style Guide

### Python

We use **Ruff** to format, lint, and auto-sort imports. The easiest way to use Ruff is through the Visual Studio Code extension, where formatting is run on save. You can also format using Ruff's CLI:

```sh
pip install ruff
ruff format .
```

### JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Markdown, JSON, YAML

We use **Prettier** for formatting. The easiest way to use Prettier is through the Visual Studio Code extension, where formatting is run on save. You can also format using Prettier's CLI:

```sh
npx prettier@2.8.8 --write .
```

Formatting is checked using a GitHub Action workflow, ensuring all PRs comply with the formatters and linting standards.
